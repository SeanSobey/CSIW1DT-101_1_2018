		<h1>About Us</h1>

		<p>Where do we start? With our 21,000 animals, in 125 acres of award-winning zoological gardens? With the 1.9 million people who come to visit every year? Or with the many conservation projects we’re involved with, at home and abroad?</p>

		<p>We work hard because we love animals, we care about nature, we love Cute Animal Zoo and we want to be the BEST conservation charity in the world!</p>

		<h2>Our mission</h2>

		<p>That devotion to the welfare and protection of wildlife has always been at the heart of everything we do. For over 80 years, we’ve dedicated ourselves to protecting biodiversity and fighting to save species from extinction.</p>

			<h3>We're a registered charity</h3>
			<p>And we're passionate about what we do. Whether it's creating a brilliant day out for you, or working with endangered wildlife around the world, we couldn't do it without your help. Learn more about our conservation work around the world on our Act for Wildlife website here.</p>

		<h2>Protecting the environment</h2>

		<p>That devotion to the welfare and protection of wildlife has always been at the heart of everything we do. For over 80 years, we’ve dedicated ourselves to protecting biodiversity and fighting to save species from extinction.</p>

		We're devoted to conservation. Every aspect of what we do is about protecting the living world and saving wildlife from extinction. We take being green very seriously. This means we’re always looking at ways we can act more sustainably to minimise our impact on the environment, in everything we do. Our very own Green Team meet regularly to improve our environmental practices and policies.
		
		<h3>Green Tourism</h3>

		<p>We're proud to be awarded Gold for Green Tourism, inspiring the highest standards of sustainability, efficiency and working practices. We use the latest technologies such as LED lighting, efficient boilers and renewable technologies such as solar power to green sourcing using local suppliers and have a range of ethical products.</p>

		<h3>International Recognition</h3>

		<p>We're the first SA zoo, and only the second one in Africa, to be awarded ISO14001. This is an independent, internationally recognised standard given to organisations that show a real commitment to looking after the environment. You only get it by proving you understand, and act, on big issues like using raw materials, energy, emissions, waste and transport. You have to meet all the environmental legal standards and once you’ve got it, you can only keep it if you keep improving your environmental policy.</p>

		<article>
			<h3>Come and see us</h3>
			<p>We're open daily from 10am all year, except Christmas Day and Boxing Day. You can park for free, or come by, bus or bicycle.</p>
