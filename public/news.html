			<h2>It's a boy! Cute Animal Zoo celebrates 'astonishing' birth of rare elephant calf</h2>
			
			<small>27 September</small>

			<h4>A rare Asian elephant calf has “astonished” experts after being born in captivity.</h4>

			<p>The newborn arrived overnight on Thursday to 35-year-old mum Thi Hi Way after an assumed gestation of 25 months.</p>

			<p>Keepers and scientists at the zoo believed that Thi had started a natural resorption process after hormone tracking showed that the mum of six previous calves was due to give birth three months prior, and she was slowly returning to her normal weight.</p>

			<p>Despite the unusual circumstances, Thi gave birth to a healthy baby boy and keepers at the zoo say both mum and calf, who is yet to be named, are doing very well.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Thi is a wonderful matriarch to our family herd and a really experienced mum. She has successfully given birth to seven calves before, but this time around circumstances were really quite astonishing.</p>
				<p>We believed Thi had exceeded her normal gestation period, which we were monitoring closely. Her hormone levels, behaviour and drop in weight gave us every indication that she may have been resorbing the calf – a natural process that some elephants experience.</p>
				<cite>Mike Jordan, Collections Director - 27 September</cite>
			</blockquote>

			<p>The Zoo is part of a breeding programme coordinated by the European Association of Zoos and Aquariums (EAZA) that is focused on sustaining the elephant population in Europe. The new calf is another huge boost to these efforts.</p>

			<p>Asian elephants are listed as endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN’s) Red List, threatened by habitat loss, poaching, disease and direct conflict with humans.</p>

			<h2>“World’s fluffiest cats” are zoo’s purr-fect new arrivals</h2>

			<small>12 September</small>
			
			<h4>Four rare felines dubbed the ‘world’s fluffiest cats’ have arrived.</h4>

			<figure>

			</figure>

			<p>It’s the first time carnivore experts at the zoo have ever cared for the animals, known as Pallas’s cats. The four brothers have arrived from Krakow Zoo in Poland.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Pallas’s cats are incredibly furry. Relative to size, they have the densest and longest fur of any cat species – effectively making them the world’s fluffiest cats.</p>
				<p>However, hunting for their beautiful fur is actually something that is contributing to their perilous plight in the wild. These cats are very poorly known, declining and, sadly, face an uncertain future.</p>
				<cite>Tim Rowlands, Curator of Mammals - 12 September</cite>
			</blockquote>

			<p>Pallas’s cats are rarely seen in their native southern Siberia, Central Asia and China where they are under threat. The most recent population estimate suggests only around 15,000 remain with conservationists fearing that number is in continuous decline.</p>

			<h2>Otter-ly adorable new pups are too much!</h2>

			<small>28 August</small>
			
			<h4>FIVE baby otters have been given their first ever health check-ups</h4>

			</figure>

			<p>The quintet of tiny pups were said to be in ‘tip-top condition’ after being checked over by the zoo’s keepers and vets who determined their sexes (four girls and a boy), weighed them, listened to their heart beats and gave them a physical examination.</p>

			<p>The Asian short-clawed otters – the world’s smallest species of otter – were born 10 weeks ago to mum Annie (3) and dad Wallace (5).</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Each of the five pups showed themselves to be feisty little characters! We’re thrilled though that every one of them is in tip-top condition and they’re all doing ever so well.</p>
				<p>We can’t wait to see them start to take to the water as they continue to grow, become more and more confident and gain independence from mum and dad.</p>
				<cite>Hannah Sievewright, Keeper - 29 August</cite>
			</blockquote>

			<p>Asian short-clawed otters are listed by conservationists as vulnerable to extinction and face increasing threats to their survival in the wild. Many areas of wetland where they are found are being taken over by human populations and some are also hunted for their skins and organs which are used in traditional Chinese medicines.</p>
